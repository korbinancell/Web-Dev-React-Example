# Web Dev React Example
Install node from [here]( https://nodejs.org/en/)

Install yarn from [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

I highly recomend VSCode it's lightweight and works great on most OS's. Install from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Install Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

If you are using Chrome you can add a great React browser extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) (if you want, Firefox has one as well)

Finally this project was bootstrapped by Create-React-App [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Tip Type the Following in command line

`git clone https://github.com/korbinancell/Web-Dev-React-Example.git`

`cd Web-Dev-React-Example`

`yarn`

After that is done `yarn start` should start the client and open it in your web browser
